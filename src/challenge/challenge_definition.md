## Gaussian Mixture Model

A common model in Machine Learning is the *Gaussin Mixture Models (GMM)*. A GMM is simply the sum of multiple normal distributions N(mu, sigma).   

For example, the density of a GMM consisting of two Normal Distributions with means at -2 and 2 and unit variance looks like this:
